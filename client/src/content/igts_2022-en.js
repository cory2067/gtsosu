# General Rules
- This tournament is a **2v2 team tournament** with teams of **5 players maximum**.
- The teams will first go through **qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **group stage** and finally play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
- The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
- Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
- Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
- Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
- All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
- Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
- In order to participate you need to meet the criteria stated in the **rank restrictions** part. 
- You are not allowed to rank up further than #4000 during the tournament. If you pass this limit you'll be disqualified. 
- Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a country role.
- osu! staff can refuse a player from participating in the tournament if they deem his skill is much higher than the targeted rank range. 
- If there are 35 or more unique countries able to participate after screening, only 1 team per country will be allowed. In that case, if there are more than 5 players signed up for a country they will decide among themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players by ranking will be chosen to form the team. 
- If there are less than 35 unique countries, we are allowing 2 teams for a country under certain conditions:
  - There are **7 or more players** signed up for a country.
  - Each team has to have **at least 3 players**.
- Because of the previous rule there are going to be different situations when creating the teams: 
  - If there are 5 players or less signed up for a country, those players will form the team representing their country. 
  - In case there are more than 10 players signed up for a country, players will decide among themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 10 players by ranking will be chosen to form the 2 teams. 
  - If there are 6 players, players will have to decide on the 5 players who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players by ranking will be chosen to form the team. 
  - If there are 7 to 10 players (after keeping the best ranked ones) signed up for a country, the players from that country will have a few days to decide how to split themselves between the 2 teams. 
  - In case the players can't come to an agreement, they will be ranked by pp and put in the 2 teams with at least 3 members in each of them with the best ones in a first team and the lowest in the second. 
- It is recommended to come to an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare your matches rapidly. 
  - The players will decide on the captain of their team. 
  - If the players can't agree or find a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen.
  - The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that his teammates are here for the matches. 

# Stage Regulations
- There are seven stages in this tournament: the Qualifiers, the Group Stage, the RO16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals and the Grand Finals. 
- The team will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds: Top seed, High seed, Low seed and Unseeded. (The seeding process is explained more precisely in the Qualifers Instructions part) 
- Teams will be drawn in **8 groups of 4 teams** during a drawing show which will happen on Sunday March 20th. 
- In the Group Stage all the teams from each group will face each other. The **best 2 teams** get out of their group. 
- Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority: 
   - Most matches won.
   - Highest (number of beatmaps won - number of maps lost) score.
   - Most beatmaps won.
   - Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.
- In Group stage, 'Win by default' will be considered as win by 5:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
- The winning condition for each stage is:
  - Group Stage: BO9 (win 5 maps)
  - RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Loser's bracket round 1, 2, 3 and 4: BO11 (win 6 maps)
  - Grand Finals: BO13 (win 7 maps)

# Qualifiers Regulations
- During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. 
- A private match will be created and teams will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time. 
- There are no warmups.
- Failed scores will count.
- Only two players from a team will be playing per map. There is no limitations on player swapping. 
- Seedings will be done with the average rank of each team on each map.
- If two teams are tied, the team who has the highest combined score of their best runs across all maps, will be seeded higher.
- Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking. 
- Only the 32 best teams will continue on to the Group Stage. 

# Match Regulations
- A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team's captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room. 
- If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed. 
- If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. 
- There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time. 
- If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes it will count as a loss for both teams in Group Stage. In the double elimination bracket the highest seeded team will advance. 
- The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "IGTS 2022: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)". 
- Each team is allowed one warm-up but the total time of the map must be below 3 minutes and must be sent to the referee and streamer of the match one hour prior to the match's start time.
- If a team does not respect the time said in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
- Each captain has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match. 
- The captain of each team will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat. 
- The team with the highest roll **bans second and picks first**. The team with the lowest roll **bans first and picks second**. 
- Each captain has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll. 
- Beatmap selection will then alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool. 
- Captains may pick freely from any bracket. 
- Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. 
- Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations. 
- If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once. 
- If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map. 
- Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per team. 
- Failed players' scores do get added to the team score. 
- If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. 
- In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected. 

# Mappool Instructions
- There will be 1 mappool for each of the following: Qualifiers, Group Stage, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
