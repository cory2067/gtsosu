# General Rules
- This tournament is a **2v2 team tournament** with teams of an undetermined amount of players for now. It will depend on players.
- The teams will play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
- The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
- Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
- Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
- Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
- All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
- Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
- In order to participate you need to be able to click two fucking buttons on this website, being Login and Register. 
- Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a player role while waiting for their actual team.
- osu! staff can refuse a player from participating in the tournament if they deem his account is suspicious.

# Stage Regulations
- There are five stages in this tournament: the RO16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals and the Grand Finals. 
- The winning condition for each stage is:
  - RO16, Quarterfinals and Loser's bracket round 1 and 2 : BO11 (win 6 maps)
  - Semifinals, Finals, Grand Finals and Loser's Bracket Round 3 and 4: BO13 (win 7 maps)

# Match Regulations
- A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team's captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room. 
- If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed. 
- If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. 
- There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time. 
- If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes, the highest seeded team will advance. 
- The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "LEGTS 2021: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)". 
- Each team is allowed one warm-up but it must be below 3 minutes, and must be sent to the referee and streamer of the match one hour prior to the match's start time.
- If a team does not respect the time said in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
- Each captain has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match. 
- The captain of each team will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat. 
- The team with the highest roll **bans second and picks first**. The team with the lowest roll **bans first and picks second**. 
- Each captain has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll. 
- Beatmap selection will then alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool. 
- Captains may pick freely from any bracket. 
- Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. 
- Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations. 
- If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once. 
- If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map. 
- Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per team. 
- Failed players' scores do get added to the team score. 
- If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. 
- In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected. 

# Mappool Instructions
- There will be 1 mappool for each of the following: RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
- The Loser's Bracket will play on the same pool as the Winner's bracket of the same weekend. 
- Each mappool consists of 6 brackets: NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, FreeMod, Hidden + HardRock and Tiebreaker. 
- The first weekend mappool will consist of 15 maps, the second and third weekend's mappool will consist of 16 maps. 
- The size of the Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime and FreeMod brackets will be of 2 in all stages and 1 for the Hidden + HardRock bracket in all stages as well.

- Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available. 
- Week-ends of this tournament will not be able to be delayed by any means. You must be available during the three weekends currently scheduled.
