  rules: `
# General Rules
 - This tournament is a **2v2 team tournament** with teams of **maximum 5 players**.
 - The teams will first go through qualifiers. Then they will play in a **group stage** and finally play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
 - The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
 - Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
 - Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
 - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
 - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
 - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
 - In order to participate you need to meet the criteria stated in the **rank restriction part**.
 - Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a country role.
 - The staff can refuse a player if they deem that the player skill is not fit with the tournament.
 - This year we are allowing 2 teams for a country under certain conditions:
   - There are **7 or more players** signed up for a country.
   - Each team has to have **at least 3 players**.
 - Because of the previous rule there are going to be different situations to create the teams:
   - If there are 5 players or less signed up for a country, those players will form the team representing their country.
   - In case there are more than 10 players signed up for a country, players will decide between themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 10 players by ranking will be chosen to form the 2 teams.
   - If there are 6 players, players will have to decide on the 5 players who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players by ranking will be chosen to form the 2 teams.
   - If there are 7 to 10 players (after keeping the best ranked ones) signed up for a country, the players from that country will have a few days to decide how to split themselves in the 2 teams.
It is recommended to find an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare your matches rapidly.
 - In the case the players can't find an agreement, they will be ranked by pp and put in the 2 teams with at least 3 members in each of them with the best ones in a first team and the lowest in the second.
 - The players will decide on the captain of their team. 
 - If the players can't agree or find a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen.
 - The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that his teammates are here for the matches.

# Stage Regulations
 - There are seven stages in this tournament: the Qualifiers, the Group Stage, the RO16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals and the Grand Finals.
 - The team will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds : Top seed, High seed, Low seed and Unseeded. (The seeding process is explained more precisely in the Qualifers Instructions part)
 - Teams will be drawn in **8 groups of 4 teams** during a drawing show which will happen on Sunday June 7th.
 - In the Group Stage all the teams from each group will face each other. The **best 2 teams** get out of groups.
