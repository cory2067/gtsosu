  # Team Registrations
 - All teams must consist of 2 players. No more, no less. 
 - **One player must have the Malaysian flag in their osu! Profile, while the second player can be from any country.**
 - A team may not consist of 2 Malaysian players.
 - There are no restrictions or limits as to who you can have on your team, with the exception of staff members and players who are already part of another team.
 - One of the team members will need to be assigned as captain and register on behalf of the pair.
 - The captain will be responsible for the scheduling process of the team throughout the tournament.
 - To register, click on the ‘Register’ button on the home page.
 - The first slot will be filled in automatically with the registering player (Captain) and the second slot will be used to fill in the partner player.
 - You must add a custom team name, as well as an optional custom team flag (Image Size 70x47). If this is left blank, the captain’s country flag will be automatically used as the team flag instead.
 - The players will then be given the relevant team and player roles in the Discord server, as well as access to a team chat. 
 - **It is mandatory to join BOTH (OTMT and GTS) Discord servers to play in this tournament, and you will be removed from the tournament if you do not do so.**
  

  # Tournament Details
 - This is a double-elimination, 2v2 osu!taiko tournament.
 - **This tournament introduces a special “Player Assist” system, which is further elaborated in the next subsection below. Please read through it carefully.**
 - ScoreV2 will be used with the Team VS option.
 - The tournament starts off with the Qualifiers stage to sort the teams into their respective seedings in the Top 24.
 - The Top 8 teams will get to skip the RO24 week and jump straight to RO16.
 - The bottom 16 teams will face each other in the RO24 week, with the losers falling down to the Loser’s bracket.
  It is important to note that the RO24 and RO16 stages will not have any Loser Bracket matches, hence:
   - The 8 teams that fall down to the Loser’s Bracket after the RO24 week will not have any matches in the RO16 week.
   - They will face the Losers of the RO16 winner’s bracket matches in the Quarterfinals week.
   - For better clarification, please look at the sample bracket layout [here](https://challonge.com/tournaments/bracket_generator?form_type=bracket_generator&ref=LgOMZhAWcS)
 - The tournament starts off with the Qualifiers stage to sort the teams into their respective seedings in the Top 32.
 - The Top 32 teams will then advance onto the Round of 32 where the knockout stages will begin.
 - The tournament hosts will release the mappool and schedule one week before each round.
 - Any members of staff apart from the **Organizers**, **Mappoolers**, **Mappers**, **Playtesters** and **Referees** are allowed to play.
 - Eliminated players midway through the tournament may sign up for the **Playtester** or **Referee** roles.
 - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
 - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all staff members as well.
 - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.
 - **In the scenario where less than 32 teams register for the tournament, the tournament format will be switched to double-elimination instead along with several other major format changes. Further details to this possible change will be communicated via the Discord servers if it happens.**

# Player Assist
 - Starting from the Round of 16, the winning teams from the previous RO24 matches will absorb their losing opponents into their team’s “bench roster”.
 - The winning team can then call upon **ANY ONE PLAYER** from this bench roster to assist with **ONE (1) MAP PER MATCH.** 
 - This assist player can replace the position of any player from the team for that one map.
 - Once the map is finished, the assist player must leave the room and the match will continue with the usual core team players.
 - Losing teams from the subsequent rounds will also be added on into the winning team’s bench roster.
   - Only the two core losing team members will be absorbed into the winning team. The players from the losing team’s bench roster will not be included (they are all fully eliminated from the tournament after this).  
 - A player from the team’s bench roster may only be called upon **ONCE throughout the entire tournament.** If Player A from the bench is called for RO16, they may not be selected again for Quarterfinals and beyond. Another player from the bench will need to be selected instead.
 - It is not mandatory to deploy a player from the bench for every match.
 - The selected **bench player will need to be decided at least 1 hour before every match and informed to the referee.**
 - The bench players that were deployed throughout the tournament by the eventual Champion Team will all receive the Custom Profile Banner prize for their assistance.

 - Invites to the room will then be sent out 10 minutes before each match.
 - If no staff or referees are available at the time of the match, it will be postponed.
 - If some players are not present, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.

 - The warmup must not exceed 3 minutes in length and not contain inappropriate or NSFW content. The referee reserves the right to reject maps that they deem to be inappropriate.
 - At the start of each match, captains will be asked to !roll to determine who picks or bans first. **The team with the higher roll will get to pick first and ban second.** 
 - Banned maps and tiebreakers are not allowed to be picked throughout the match.
 - Each team will be given a maximum of 2 minutes to select their picks/bans. If a pick has not been decided before the countdown timer ends, the map will be randomized with !roll by the referee.
 - After a map has been decided, players will then have a maximum of 2 minutes to ready up before the referee forces a start.
 - Players should ensure that they have all the maps downloaded before the start of their match. In the event that a player is missing a map, their team will automatically lose the point if they are unable to download it within the 2 minutes given.

 - Lag is not a valid reason to restart a map.
 - In the event of a tie in scores, the map will be played again (both teams will not gain points).
 - In the unlikely event that both teams get a tied score two times in a row on the same map, the map will be nullified and another map needs to be picked (by the other team).
