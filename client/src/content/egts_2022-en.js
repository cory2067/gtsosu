- The Loser's Bracket will play on the same pool as the Winner's bracket of the same weekend.
- The Qualifiers pool will be different from all the other rounds, as it will have a format of 3 NoMod maps, 2 Hidden maps, 2 HardRock maps, 2 DoubleTime maps, and a ForceMod map.
- Each mappool consists of 6 brackets: **NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, ForceMod, and Tiebreaker**.

# Scheduling Instructions
- Every stage will be held **during the weekend**. (it is however allowed to schedule on another day if no good time is found during the weekend and a referee is available)
- We will try to schedule as best as possible to fit with the timezones. The schedule will be released the previous weekend of each stage.
- Reschedules will only be considered if both players agree to a time, this needs to be done and notified to the tournament staff before **Thursday at 23:59 UTC** in that particular week when your match takes place.

# Match Regulations
- A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both players will be invited into the room when it's match time. 
- If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed.
- If one of the players is late, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
- There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time.
- If neither of the players are in the lobby after 10 minutes, the highest seeded player will advance.
- The match will be played as Head to Head and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "EGTS 2022: (Player Red) vs (Player Blue)".
- Each player is allowed one warm-up but it must be below 3 minutes, and must be put on the website one hour prior to the match's start time.
- Warm-ups may not be offensive or NSFW (not safe for work).
- If a player does not respect the time said in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
- Each player has to ban **one beatmap** to be selected from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player in the entire match.
- Each player will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat.
- The player with the **highest roll bans second and picks first**. The player with **the lowest roll bans first and picks second**.
- Each player has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll.
- Beatmap selection will then alternate between each player selecting a beatmap out of the map pool.
- Players may pick freely from any bracket.
- Players will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. And if players do not get ready before the end of the timer, the match will be started, no matter what.
- If a player disconnects between the beatmaps, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum. This delay can only be applied once.
- If a player disconnects after 30 seconds, they get treated as if they lost the map.
- Disconnects within 30 seconds after beatmap begin can be rematched. This is only allowed once per player.
- Failed players' scores do count.
- If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the player who picked it will have to pick another map.
- In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected.
