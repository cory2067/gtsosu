  # General Rules
  - This tournament is a **2v2 team tournament** with teams of **5 players maximum**.
  - The teams will first go through **Qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **Group Stage**, a **Runoff Bracket** and finally in a **Double-elimination Bracket**.
  - The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
  - Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
  - Any member of **staff** (**Organizers, Mappoolers, Playtesters/Replayers, Custom Mappers and Referees**) is not allowed to play. Other positions considered as **helpers** (**Commentators**, **Streamers**, ...) are allowed to play.
  - Players who have been eliminated from the tournament are allowed to join staff as **Referees or Playtesters/Replayers**. Other staff roles are not allowed. They can also join the **helpers** at any moment.
  - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
  - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
  - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.
  - Any report to be made in relation to this tournament's organization should be sent to the official tournament committee [reporting form](https://pif.ephemeral.ink/partial-authenticate).
  
  # Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
  - In order to participate you need to meet the criteria stated in the **rank restrictions** part.
  - You are not allowed to rank up further than #500 during the registration period and then further than #400 during the actual tournament. If you pass this limit you'll be disqualified.
  - osu! staff can refuse a player from participating in the tournament if they deem his skill is much higher than the targeted rank range.
  - Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a country role.
  - A country needs **at least 2 players** to participate.
  - Players from countries or territories (as seen on their profile flag) that are under a protectorate, sovereign state, or otherwise closely related to another country may choose to play for that country if the country listed on their profile is unable to field enough players to form a valid team.
  - If there are 35 or more unique countries able to participate after screening, only 1 team per country will be allowed. In that case, if there are more than 5 players signed up for a country they will decide among themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players by ranking will be chosen to form the team.
  - If there are less than 35 unique countries, we are **allowing 2 teams** for a country under certain conditions:
    - There are **7 or more players** signed up for a country.
    - Each team has to have **at least 3 players**.
  - Because of the previous rule there are going to be different situations when creating the teams:
    - If there are 5 players or less signed up for a country, those players will form the team representing their country.
    - In case there are more than 10 players signed up for a country, players will decide among themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 10 players by ranking will be chosen to form the 2 teams.
    - If there are 6 players, players will have to decide on the 5 players who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players by ranking will be chosen to form the team.
    - If there are 7 to 10 players (after keeping the best ranked ones) signed up for a country, the players from that country will have a few days to decide how to split themselves between the 2 teams.
    - In case the players can't come to an agreement, they will be ranked by pp and put in the 2 teams with at least 3 members in each of them with the best ones in a first team and the lowest in the second.
  - It is recommended to come to an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare your matches rapidly.
    - The players will decide on the captain of their team.
    - If the players can't agree or find a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen.
    - The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that his teammates are here for the matches.
  
  # Stage Regulations
  - There are 4 main stages in this tournament: the Qualifiers, the Group Stage, the Runoff Bracket, the Main Bracket.
  - Teams will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds: Top seed, High seed, Low seed and Unseeded. (The seeding process is explained more precisely in the Qualifers Instructions part)
  - Teams seeded 1-8 will skip the first 2 weeks while teams seeded 9-16 skip the first week.
  - **Group Stage**
    - Teams seeded 17-32 will be drawn in **4 groups of 4 teams** during a drawing show which will happen on Sunday April 16th.
    - In the Group Stage all the teams from each group will face each other. The **best 2 teams** get out of their group.
    - Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
        - Most matches won.
        - Highest (number of beatmaps won - number of maps lost) score.
        - Most beatmaps won.
        - Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.
    - In Group stage, 'Win by default' will be considered as win by 5:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
    - The top 2 teams of each group will join the teams seeded 9-16 in the Runoff Bracket.
  - **Runoff Bracket**
    - The Runoff Bracket is an intermediate bracket in which teams will compete to have a chance to play in the main bracket.
    - The Winner Bracket will see the teams seeded 9-16 play against each other (9 will play against 16 and so on).
        - The winner of this match will go on to play in the main bracket. The loser will play against the winner of the Loser Bracket match.
    - The Loser Bracket will see teams who finished first place in their group play against a second place team (1st of A vs 2nd of D, 1st of B vs 2nd of C, 1st of C vs 2nd of B, 1st of D vs 2nd of A)
        - The winner of this match will go on to play against the loser of the Winner Bracket match. The loser is eliminated.
    - The second round of the Loser Bracket matches will keep the order from the first set of matches (Loser of 9 vs 16 play against winner of 1st of A vs 2nd of D and so on).
      - The winner of this match will go on to play in the main bracket. The loser is eliminated from the tournament.
  - **Main Bracket**
    - From this stage, the tournament will follow a classic double-elimination bracket format.
    - Teams that went out from the Runoff Bracket on their first match will be placed against teams seeded 5-8 while the others will play against the teams seeded 1-4.
    - The matchups will follow the Runoff Bracket match IDs in reverse order. The first 4 IDs are for the Runoff Bracket winner bracket matches while the last 4 are for the loser bracket. (for example: ID 1 corresponds to seed 9 vs seed 16, winner of this match will play against seed 8. For LB, ID 8 is loser of ID 1 vs winner of 1st of A vs 2nd of D and will play against seed 1.)
  - The winning condition for each stage is:
    - **Week 1/Group Stage: BO9 (win 5 maps)**
    - **Week 2 & 3 & 4/Runoff bracket, Round Of 16 + Quarterfinals + Semifinals + Loser's Bracket Round 1, 2 and 3: BO11 (win 6 maps)**
    - **Week 5 & 6/Finals, Grand Finals + Loser's Bracket Round 4, 5 and 6: BO13 (win 7 maps)**

  # Match Regulations
  - A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team's captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room.
  - If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed.
  - If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
  - There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time.
  - If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes it will count as a loss for both teams in Group Stage. In the Runoff Bracket or the Main Bracket the highest seeded team will advance.
  - The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "AGTS2023: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)".
  - Each team is allowed one warm-up but the total time of the map must be below 3 minutes. The warm-up must be uploaded on the website up to one hour prior to the match's start time. Teams will be allowed to send warmups starting from the day schedules release.
  - If a team does not respect the time said in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.

  - Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
  - If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once.
