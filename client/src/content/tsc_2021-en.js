  rules: `
  # General Rules
 - This tournament is a **4v4 team tournament** with teams of **8 players maximum**. Teams are formed randomly, during the teams drawings stream.
 - The teams will first go through **a seeding phase**. Then they will play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
 - The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
 - Any player who meets the requirements stated in the rank restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu! staff.
 - Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
 - Anyone with an ongoing tournament ban cannot be a staff member as an Organizer, Mappooler or Referee.
 - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
 - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
 - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
 - Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a player role. 
 - Teams will have to decide on their captain and team logo whenever their team has been finalized.
   It is recommended to come to an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare your matches rapidly. 
   - If the players can't agree or find a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen.
 - The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that his teammates are here for the matches. 

# Stage Regulations
 - There are seven stages in this tournament: the Qualifiers, the RO32, the RO16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals and the Grand Finals. 
 - The team will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds: Top seed, High seed, Low seed and Unseeded. (The seeding process is explained more precisely in the Qualifers Instructions part)  
 - The winning condition for each stage is:
   - RO32, RO16, Quarterfinals and Loser's bracket round 1: BO9 (win 5 maps)
   - Quarterfinals and Loser's bracket round 2 and 3: BO11 (win 6 maps)
   - Semifinals, Finals, Grand Finals and Loser's Bracket Round 4, 5 and 6: BO13 (win 7 maps)

# Seeding Phase Regulations
 - During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. 
 - A private match will be created and teams will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time. 
 - There are no warmups.
 - Failed scores will count.
 - Only four players from a team will be playing per map. There is no limitations on player swapping. 
 - Seedings will be done with the average rank of each team on each map. 
 - Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking. 
 - All teams will go through, as it is there only for seeding purposes.

# Match Regulations
 - A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team's captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room. 
 - If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed. 
 - If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. 
 - There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time. 
 - If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes, the highest seeded team will advance. 
 - The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "TSC 2021: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)". 
 - Each team is allowed one warm-up but it must be below 3 minutes, and must be sent to the referee and streamer of the match one hour prior to the match's start time. Otherwise, the team will have no warmups.
 - If a team does not respect the time said in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
 - Each captain has to ban **one beatmap** from Mappool A. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match. 
 - The captain of each team will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat. 
 - The team with the highest roll **gets first warmup, first ban and first pick**.
 - Each captain has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll. 
 - Beatmap selection will then alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool. 
 - Captains may pick freely from any bracket. 
 - Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. 
 - Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations. 
 - If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once. 
 - If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map. 
 - Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per team. 
 - Failed players' scores do get added to the team score. 
 - If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. 
 - In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected. 

# Mappool Instructions
 - There will be 1 mappool for each of the following: Qualifiers, RO32, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals. A different pool will be prepared for All-Star (see All-Star Rules for more details). 
 - The Qualifiers pool will be different from all the other rounds as it will have a format of 1 NoMod map, 1 Challenge map, 1 Hard Rock map, 1 Double Time map. 
 - The Loser's Bracket will play on the same pool as the Winner's bracket of the same weekend. 
 - The mappool format for all bracket rounds of Suiji 2021 will be different from most other tournaments, since it is two mappools into one. The A mappool, as well as the B mappool.

# Scheduling Instructions
 - Every stage is held **during the weekend**. (It is however allowed to schedule on another day if no agreement is found on a time during the weekend) 
 - Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available. 
 - We will try to schedule as best as possible so it fits with the time zones. The schedule will be released the previous weekend of each stage.
