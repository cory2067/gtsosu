# Contest Rules
- This contest is an **osu!taiko single-round team-based contest** with teams of **4 players minimum**, and **6 players maximum**. 
- **All submissions should abide by the [Ranking Criteria](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Ranking_Criteria).** Mistakes happen and may affect judging, but submissions that cannot be ranked without major changes will be disqualified. (It's allowed to ignore spread rules for the sake of this contest.)
- **Submissions must NOT be uploaded/shared with others before judging and results are announced.** Sharing entries publicly by any means before the results are announced will result in a disqualification, no questions asked.
- **Submissions will not be accepted after the deadlines.** No exceptions.
- Participants must have read this ruleset **entirely** (and we will assume you did so throughout the contest).
- Any team that hasn't followed the **team creation process** and the **entry submission process** properly **will** be disqualified.
- **At least two (2) mappers must collaborate per song.** This is a team-based competition. Collaboration is necessary to determine the strengths of each participating country as a whole. We want to avoid pure carry situations amongst teams. Collaboration does not include anything other than mapping.
- **If a mapper on the winning team does not participate in at least 2 out of the 3 songs given, they will not receive their badge reward for the contest.** This is to avoid the case of someone joining the team just to get a free carry, so this should incentivize participation from ALL members on a team.
- Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Contest Registration and Teams Creation
- In order to participate you need to need to be in a team of **4 to 6 players** of your choosing. There is no limit to who you can have on your team, with exception to the contest's staff members and people who are already on another team.
- One member of the team will need to be the captain. This should be decided before you sign up.
- The captain is going to be the one to submit the entry through the [Mappers' Guild Website](https://mappersguild.com/contests/listing?contest=640260c3517b1f1d40ca88e1).
- To sign up, the captain will need to register your entire team via the 'register' button on the home page.
  - The person in the first slot is the captain. This will be filled in automatically with the player who is registering, hence why the captain needs to be the one registering.
  - You must add a custom team name.
  - You can add a custom flag, a link to an image of size 70x47. This isn't mandatory, but leaving this blank means the country flag of the team captain is taken as your team's flag.
- One of the hosts will give you your team and player roles in the discord, as well as access to a team chat. It might take some time before this is done as this needs to be done manually.

# Submission Process
- In order to prepare a valid submission, you need to create a \`.zip\` file that contains the following files:
  - Your 3 beatmaps, each one in \`.osz\` format.
  - A text file containing a list of all parts of each map, and who mapped them.
- The captain will need to submit the \`.zip\` file through the [Mappers' Guild Website](https://mappersguild.com/contests/listing?contest=640260c3517b1f1d40ca88e1).
  - If any one other than the captain submits the entry, the entry will be disqualified.

# Judging Criteria
Total score will consist of the (standardized) combined scores of the 3 maps. Each map will be judged with the following criteria:
- **Structure (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map is internally designed (consistency, concept introduction, etc.).
- **Relevance (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map represents the song and how well it plays.
- **Creativity (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how the submission uses creative and fitting elements to make itself stand out.
- **Judge's Impression (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on what the judge thinks about your entry.
- **Ranking Criteria (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map abides by the ranking criteria.
