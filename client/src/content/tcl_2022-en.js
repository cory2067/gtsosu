# Stage Regulations
1. There are Six stages to this tournament: Qualifiers, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
2. Matches are seed based. This will happen in the seeding round (Qualifiers). More information will be held in Seeding Regulations.
3. Assuming this tournament has 20 Group Stage participants, the top 2 teams in each group of 5 will advance to the Upper Bracket Top 8. The 3rd and 4th place teams in their group will be placed into the Lower Bracket. The 5th place team is eliminated.
4. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
	Most matches won.
	Highest (number of beatmaps won - number of maps lost) score.
	Most beatmaps won.
	Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.
5. In Group stage, 'Win by default' will be considered as win by 5:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
6. The winning condition for each stage is:
	Group Stage, Quarterfinals, and Loser's bracket round 1: BO9 (win 5 maps)
	Semifinals and Loser's bracket round 2 and 3 : BO11 (win 6 maps)
	Finals, Grand Finals, and Loser's Bracket Round 4, 5, and 6: BO13 (win 7 maps)
# Qualifiers Regulations
1. During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. 
2. A private match will be created and teams will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time. 
3. There are no warmups.
4. Failed scores will count. 
5. Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. However, players can ask for a break of between 2 and 5 minutes between each run. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking. 
6. Only the 20 best teams will continue on to the Group Stage.
# Seeding Regulations
1. As mentioned, seedings will be done with the average rank of each player on each map.
2. The teams will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round.
2. Each team will then be placed into a group according to the seed to provide the most balanced groups possible. When the number of teams participating is finalised, this will be explained more in detail about how seeds are accurately placed into groups.
# Match Regulations
1. A private match will be created for your match, and both teams will be invited into their match when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time.
2. There will be NO warmups.
3. Here is how bans and picks will happen. The winner of the !roll will elect if they want to pick or ban first, then the teams will alternate bans. Following this, the teams will alternate picks.
4. However, we will be introducing a new concept, called protected maps. During the ban phase, each team is allowed to protect a map from being banned by the other team. All rounds will have 1 protection per team.
5. The format of the full ban and pick phase will look like this: Team 2 Protection #1 -> Team 1 Protection #1 -> Team 2 Ban #1 -> Team 1 Ban #1 (Bans will occur twice starting at Finals weekend) -> Team 1 Pick #1...
4. A team can't ban a map from the same category twice, but their opponent can ban a map from the same category as him.
5. You can ban or pick a map that your team has protected.
6. You can protect the same map as another team in the case that the other team may use their protection as a bluff.
7. In case of a tie, the tiebreaker is selected.
6. Results will be displayed on the website, on Challonge, and announced by the referee in the #match-feed channel of the Discord server.
# Mappool Instructions
1. There's a different pool in each stage of the tournament, becoming progressively harder.
2. NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, FreeMod, Challenge, and TieBreaker are the seven categories that exist for this tournament.
3. Tiebreaker is played with FreeMod. If a team draws on a Tiebreaker, it will be replayed with forced mods.
4. FreeMod is played with NoMod, Hidden, and / or HardRock. However, you do not HAVE to play with a mod.
5. As stated previously, the mappool is released every Sunday, a week before that round's matches. 
# Scheduling Instructions
1. Every stage is held **during the weekend**. (It is however allowed to schedule on another day if no agreement is found on a time during the weekend) 
2. Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available. 
3. We will try to schedule as best as possible so it fits with the time zones. The schedule will be released the previous weekend of each stage. 
4. Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree on a time. Proof of that needs to be sent to the tournament staff before **Thursday at 23:59 UTC+0** in that particular week when your match takes place.
