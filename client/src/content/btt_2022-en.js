- Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers, Mappers and Referees** are allowed to play.
- Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
- All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
- Any rules changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced on the discord server.

# Stage Regulations
- There are eight stages to this tournament: Qualifiers, Round of 64, Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
- Participating players will be seeded based on the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round.
- The winning conditions for each state are as follows:

  - Finals, Grand Finals: Best-Of-13 (First to 7 points)

# Qualifiers Regulations
- During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. 
- A private match will be created and players will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time.
- If a player who signed up to a lobby is late for that lobby, the lobby will be postponed up to 5 minutes before it starts.
- Late players are allowed to join their lobby until 15 minutes after the lobby time (so they have 10 minutes after the lobby starts). They join the others wherever they are in the quals pool and play the maps they missed after everyone else is done.
- Players who still haven't shown up will need to reschedule to a later time.
- There are no warmups.
- Failed scores will count. NoFail will be enforced.
- Seedings will be done with the average rank of each player on each map. 
- Maps will be played once in a row during the lobby. 
- Only the 64 best players will continue on to the bracket stage.
- Qualifier scores are to remain private as much as possible until the results are released by the staff. So don't go posting or streaming your qualifiers!

# Mappool Instructions
- There will be 1 mappool for each of the following: Qualifiers, Round of 64, Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
- The Loser's Bracket will play on the same pool as the Winner's bracket of the same weekend.
- The mappools will consist of the following brackets: NoMod, Hidden, Hardrock, DoubleTime, HiddenHardrock and TieBreaker.
- The qualifiers pool will be different from all the other rounds, as it will have 4 NoMod maps, 2 Hidden maps, 2 HardRock map, and 2 DoubleTime maps.
- The NoMod bracket will have 4 maps in Round of 64 till Quarterfinals, 5 maps in Semifinals, and 6 maps in Finals and Grand Finals
- The Hidden and Hardrock brackets will have 2 maps each in Round of 64 and Round of 32, and 3 maps each in all following rounds.
- The DoubleTime bracket will have 2 maps in Round of 64 till Round of 16, and 3 maps in all following rounds.
- The HiddenHardrock bracket will have 1 map in both the Finals and Grand Finals. There will be none in earlier rounds.
- The TiebBeaker is played with FreeMod, meaning it can be played with NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, or Hidden + Hardrock. You do not have to play with a mod, but it does give a significant score boost if you wish to try and practice it.
- The mappool for each stage will be showcased a week beforehand, on sunday.

# Scheduling Instructions
- Every stage is held **during the weekend**. (It is however allowed to schedule on another day if no agreement is found on a time during the weekend) 
- Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available. 
- We will try to schedule as best as possible so it fits with the time zones. The schedule will be released the weekend before each stage. 
- Reschedules will only be considered if both players agree on a time. Proof of that (screenshot) along with the new match time needs to be sent in #reschedules before **Thursday at 23:59 UTC+0** in that particular week when your match takes place.

# Match Regulations
- A private match will be created 10-15 minutes before your match by a referee. Both players will be invited when it's match time. Make certain you're online at this time.
- The match will be played with HeadToHead and ScoreV2. The name of the lobby must be: "BTT7: (Red Player) vs (Blue Player)
- If no referee is available, the match will be postponed.
- If one of the players is late, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 15 minutes. If there is still just 1 player in the lobby after the 15-minute time limit, the present player will win by default (WBD).
- There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time.
- If neither of the players are in the lobby after 15 minutes, the highest seeded player will advance.
- Each player is allowed one warm-up. It must be below 3:00 in drain time. **No exceptions.**
- After both warm-ups have been played, the referee will ask the players to roll. This is done by typing '!roll' in the chat. The player with the highest number wins the roll.
- Each player has to ban **one beatmaps**. These maps cannot be picked by either player for the entire match.
- The roll loser bans first. The roll winner bans second.
- Players have 2 minutes to announce their ban. If they did not announce their ban in time, their ban will be made with a roll by the referee.
- The TieBreaker cannot be banned. A player and their opponent can both ban a map from the same modpool. If a player bans a DT, their opponent can ban another DT if they want.
- After the bans, the roll winner will pick the first map to be played. After the map, the roll loser will pick the second map. Picks will then alternate between the players.
- Like with the bans, players have 2 minutes to announce their pick to the referee. If they did not announce their pick in time, their pick will be made with a roll by the referee.
- Any map that was **NOT** banned, already played, or the TieBreaker can be picked.
- Players will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. And if players do not get ready before the end of the timer, the match will be started, no matter what.
- If a player disconnects between the beatmaps, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum. This delay can only be applied once.
- If a player disconnects after 30 seconds, they get treated as if they lost the map.
- Disconnects within 30 seconds after beatmap begin can be rematched. This is only allowed once per player.
- If a player disconnects after 30 seconds, but can show a screenshot the local score with a **fitting time stamp**, and it's higher than the opponent's score, they still win the point. It is up to the referee to decide if its legit.
- If someone tries to abuse the rule above and we see you're trying to pass a different score, you will instantly lose the match.
- Failed players' scores do count.
- If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the player who picked it will have to pick another map.
- If both players reach match point (1 more point needed to win), the TieBreaker will be played.
- Results will be displayed on the website, on Challonge, and announced by the referee in the #match-feed channel of the Discord server.
- If both players tie on the TieBreaker, the TieBreaker will be replayed.
