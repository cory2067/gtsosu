  # General Rules
 - This tournament is a **3v3 team tournament** with teams of **6 players maximum**.
 - The teams will first go through **qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
 - The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
 - Any player who meets the requirements stated in the restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament will aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
 - Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
 - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
 - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
 - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Tournament Registration and Teams Creation
 - In order to participate you need to need to be in a team of **3 to 6 players** of your choosing. There is no limit to who you can have on your team, with exception to the staff members mentioned above and players who are already part of another team.
 - One member of the team will need to be the captain. This should be decided before you sign up.
 - The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that his teammates are here for the matches.
 - To sign up, the captain will need to register your entire team via the 'register' button on the home page. 
    - The person in the first slot is the captain. This will be filled in automatically with the player who is registering, hence why the captain needs to be the one registering.
	- You must add a custom team name.
	- You can add a custom flag, a link to an image of size 70x47. This isn't mandatory, but leaving this blank means the country flag of the team captain is taken as your team's flag.
- One of the hosts will give you your team and player roles in the discord, as well as access to a team chat. It might take some time before this is done as this needs to be done manually.
- Teams will be numbered in order of signup. This number will be used for your team chat, as well as your teamname if you do not submit a custom teamname.

# Stage Regulations
 - There are seven stages in this tournament: Qualifiers, RO32, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals. 
 - Teams will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round.
 - The winning condition for each stage is:
   - Round of 32, Round of 16 and Loser's Bracket Round 1: BO9 (win 5 maps)
   - Quarterfinals and Loser's Bracket Round 2 and 3: BO11 (win 6 maps)
   - Semifinals, Finals, Grand Finals and Loser's Bracket Round 4, 5, 6, 7 and Grand Finals: BO13 (win 7 maps)

# Qualifiers Regulations
 - During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. 
 - A private match will be created and team captains will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain you're online at this time. 
 - There are no warmups.
 - Failed scores will count.
 - Only three players from a team will be playing per map. There are no limitations on player swapping. 
 - Seedings will be done with the average rank of each team on each map. 
 - Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking. 
 - Only the 32 best teams will continue on to the bracket stage. 

# Match Regulations
 - A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room. 
 - If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed. 
 - If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. 
 - There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time. 
 - If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes the highest seeded team will advance. 
 - The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "GTS6SGTS: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)". 
 - Each team is allowed one warm-up but it must be below 3 minutes, and must be uploaded to the website up to one hour prior to the match's start time. Teams will be allowed to send warmups starting from the day schedules release.
 - If a team does not respect the time mentioned in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
 - Warm-ups may not be offensive or NSFW (not safe for work).
 - Only the captain can give their team's picks, ban and roll to the referee.
 - Each captain has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match. 
 - The captain of each team will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat. 
 - The team with the highest roll **bans second and picks first**. The team with the lowest roll **bans first and picks second**. 
 - Each captain has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll. 
 - Beatmap selection will then alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the map pool. 
 - Teams may pick freely from any bracket. 
 - Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. 
 - Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations. 
 - If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once. 
 - If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map. 
 - Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per team. 
 - Failed players' scores do get added to the team score. 
 - If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the team who picked it will have to pick another map.
 - In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected. 

# Mappool Instructions
 - There will be 1 mappool for each of the following stages: Qualifiers, RO32, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
 - The Qualifiers pool will be different from all the other rounds as it will have a format of 2 NoMod maps, 1 Hidden maps, 1 HardRock maps, 1 DoubleTime map, and 1 FreeMod map. 
 - The Loser's Bracket will play on the same pool as the Winner's bracket of the same weekend. 
 - Each mappool consists of 6 brackets: NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, FreeMod and Tiebreaker. 
 - The Round of 32 and Round of 16 mappool will consist of 14 maps, the Quarterfinals mappool will consist of 15 maps, the SemiFinals, Finals and Grand Finals mappool will consist of 16 maps.
 - The size of the NoMod bracket will be 4 in Round of 32 and Round of 16, 5 in Quarterfinals and 6 in Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
 - The size of the Hidden, HardRock and DoubleTime brackets will be 2 in all stages and 3 for the FreeMod bracket in all stages as well. 
 - The FreeMod pool is played with FreeMod activated. **Each team** needs to have **a minimum of 2 mods selected** for FreeMod picks. This can be Hidden or Hard Rock and **both mods can be selected by one player** to satisfy the 2-mod requirement. 
 - Players cannot choose the same mods. The only exception to this being the combination of **HDHR, NM and NM** as stated in the rule above.
 - The Tiebreaker is played under FreeMod conditions but it is not necessary that at least one player has at least one mode activated. 
 - The mappool for each stage will be showcased a week beforehand. 

# Scheduling Instructions
 - Every stage is held **during the weekend**. (It is however allowed to schedule on another day if no agreement is found on a time during the weekend and a referee is available)
 - Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available. 
 - We will try to schedule as best as possible so it fits with the time zones. The schedule will be released the previous weekend of each stage. 
 - Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree on a time. Proof of that needs to be sent to the tournament staff before **Thursday at 23:59 UTC+0** in that particular week when your match takes place. 
 - Reschedules may only be requested by **a team captain**.
